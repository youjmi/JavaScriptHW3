I present you my JavaScript Password Generator.

My biggest difficulty while doing this homework was able to ensure that every option that was selected is to be applied to the final result. After I finished the basic skeleton and fiddled around with it, the generated password was just spitting out what was chosen with a 40% chance of not guaranteeing the options that were actually selected. Then I created a new string and applied random selections per options to store it and then regurgitate the stored selected options to the final equation. 

Another issue I had was seeing too many commas in my generated password. This was due to me using the split method instead of typing out every character individually into an array. Without submitting to defeat, I utilized .join to help eliminate my previous issue.
